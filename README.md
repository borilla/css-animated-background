# css-animated-background
Rotating, colour-changing background using CSS animations, based on an idea from http://designrshub.com/2013/01/css3-keyframe-animations.html

Improved in http://jsfiddle.net/borilla/zrw2Ly1f/

*Note:* Animations only currently work in webkit browsers because I was too lazy to add other vendor prefixes
